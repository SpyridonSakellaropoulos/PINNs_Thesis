# Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) Thesis Code

This repository contains the code developed for my Master's thesis on Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for solving wave equations. The thesis itself, as well as the comments in the code, are written in **Greek**.  

## Overview

The repository includes scripts for simulating various wave equations using PINNs, including:

- Linear Wave Equation
- Nonlinear Korteweg–de Vries (KdV) Equation
- Non-Linear Schrödinger (NLS) Equation
- Burgers' Equation
- Camassa-Holm Equation
- Matlab codes for

## Additional Material

The repository also includes MATLAB codes used for the numerical comparison of the results. In particular, a finite difference scheme combined with a 4th-order Runge–Kutta (RK4) method is implemented to validate the PINN approximations.


Each script is **well-commented in Greek** to explain the methodology and implementation details. 

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- NumPy, Matplotlib
- CUDA (optional, for GPU acceleration)

## Notes

- The code follows the methodology described in the thesis.
- The comments are in Greek to match the thesis documentation.
- Feel free to explore and adapt the code for further experiments.
